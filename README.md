# bush-clock

I've spent ages on this, and I don't know why, really - it's well over-engineered for what it is. But it's a clock that tells the time in the style of the Bush VCR clock. It's a bit of a joke, really, but I've had fun making it.

Credit goes to the original artist who was trying to make a brush, from what I understand. Anyway, thank you [TransientCode](https://x.com/TransientCode), for the inspiration - I hope you like it!

The numerals are in a three by five grid, and I'm pondering whether that would work for more glyphs such as letters and punctuation. I'm not sure if I'll do that, but it's a thought.

Speaking of the grid, it's worth noting that not all rows are created equal - the even and odd numbered rows are different heights, and the colon is a different width to the numerals. That's not been helped by some image tiles being of different heights either; some are 16 by 32 and some are 16 by 16.
